## Contributors

We welcome pull requests that fix visual bugs or make the site more usable, especially on mobile devices.

Please refrain from sending large pull requests that only do things like refactor CSS without making visual enhancements, as the maintanence cost associated with "refactoring pull reqeusts" is considerable.

Thanks!
